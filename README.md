Project: Night Writer

Group Member Names: Nikki and Pat

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? We hope to get a fully functional project submitted on time, while demonstrating comprehension of the needed components of the project

Goals and expectations:

Team strengths: We are good at debugging using Pry/testing.  Git work flow,
How to overcome obstacles: Communication is key.  We will reach out to each other then to the rest of the class for help.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): Afternoon sessions on weekends morning sessions Monday - wednesday

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):  We will communicate view slack, and will be available during most hours.  Regular checkins on completed component functionality.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): Improvement with hashes which we will be using as the translation dictionary.  Learning and mastering how to have ruby interact with files.  

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):  Weâ€™ll work together while we can, but if we are unable to meet in person we can communicate our ideas through slack snippets/screen sharing.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):  Smaller commits that are explicit in what they are, and consist of small pieces of functionality to be merged into the master branch.  The other person will review pull requests.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Ideally in person and at the earliest time to avoid issues later on in the project and to prevent the harboring of hostilities between the team.

Agenda to discuss project launch:  

Ideas: Project seems to have similarities to the code challenge we tackled yesterday, we should also familiarize ourselves with the way Ruby interacts with other files by reading the lesson or completing the exercises posted in slack.

Tools: MCABOOK!
Additional Notes:  Setting smaller deadlines to break the project into more manageable pieces.
